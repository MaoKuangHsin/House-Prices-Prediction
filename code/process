### Part 1 ï¼šLoad, clean, and perform initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on house_dataset.csv.   
- Establish the strict train/test split and the cross-validation strategy.   
- Develop a simple baseline linear model (e.g., OLS with basic numerical features) to set an initial performance mark.
- Handoff: Provide the cleaned training data, test data, CV framework code, and baseline model results.
